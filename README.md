## Some of my messages
When I build a project in the blockchain industry, or more specifically, DeFi projects, I consider the interests of many parties: venture investors, users, and myself when I build that project. 
I also take into account the interests of individual investors when they purchase TcProtocol tokens when they are publicly issued. 
In TcProtocol, I also pay attention to the interests of liquidators. 
I do not concern myself with what others are doing with their projects or what my competitors are up to. 
My primary focus is on myself and the project I am developing. 
I wonder: which side will not benefit when this project is actually implemented?
What should I do when one of the parties does not want to participate in my protocol or project? How can I fairly distribute benefits so that all parties benefit?

I think that's the biggest reason why I was able to achieve success in this industry even though I'm just a newcomer entering the industry in mid-2023.
